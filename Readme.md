## What is this?

Most developers use SQL engines — this project builds one. From a raw string like:

```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 20 ORDER BY name;
```

...to actual query results, every step is implemented by hand: tokenization, parsing, semantic validation, query planning, optimization, and execution.

## Pipeline

```
Raw SQL string
     ↓
Lexer          → breaks string into tokens
     ↓
Parser         → builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
     ↓
Semantic Analyzer → validates tables, columns, types
     ↓
Query Planner  → converts AST into a logical execution plan
     ↓
Optimizer      → picks the cheapest way to execute
     ↓
Executor       → fetches data, returns results
```

## SQL Support

**Currently supported:**
- `SELECT` with multiple columns
- `FROM` with a single table
- `WHERE` with comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`)
- `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`

**Planned:**
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- Subqueries
- `JOIN`

## Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./sql-engine
```

## Stage Progress

- [x] Stage 1 — Lexer / Tokenizer
- [x] Stage 2 — Parser (AST Builder)
- [ ] Stage 3 — Semantic Analyzer
- [ ] Stage 4 — Query Planner
- [ ] Stage 5 — Optimizer
- [ ] Stage 6 — Execution Engine
- [ ] Stage 7 — Storage Layer
- [ ] Stage 8 — REPL Interface


### Stage 1 — Lexer / Tokenizer ✅

Implemented in `include/token.h` and `src/lexer/lexer.cpp`.

- Defined `TokenType` enum covering all SQL token categories: keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER`, `BY`, `GROUP`), identifiers, operators (`>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`), literals (`INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`), symbols (`,`, `;`, `(`, `)`), and `END_OF_FILE`
- Defined `Token` struct holding a `TokenType` and a `std::string` value
- Lexer walks the raw SQL string character by character using maximal munch — reads full words, full numbers, and multi-character operators before deciding the token type
- Handles: keyword vs identifier distinction, integer and float literals, single-quoted strings, all comparison operators, and symbols
- Appends `END_OF_FILE` token at the end so the parser knows when to stop

## Bug Found in Stage 1 — Unterminated String Literal

While testing the lexer, a silent failure was identified in string literal handling.

**The input:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE city = 'Delhi
```

**What happened:**

The lexer produced a valid-looking `STRING` token with value `Delhi` and moved on. No error, no crash. The missing closing quote was completely ignored.

**Why this is dangerous:**

A silent failure here poisons everything downstream. The parser receives what looks like a well-formed token stream and has no way to know the original query was broken. Errors like this should be caught at the earliest possible stage — the lexer — not discovered three layers deep in the parser or executor.

**The fix:**

After the string scanning loop, explicitly check if the loop exited because it ran out of input rather than finding a closing quote:

```cpp
else if (input[i] == '\'') {
    std::string str;
    i++; // skip opening quote
    while (i < input.length() && input[i] != '\'') {
        str.push_back(input[i]);
        i++;
    }

    // FIX: detect unterminated string
    if (i >= input.length()) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Lexer error: unterminated string literal");
    }

    tokens.push_back({TokenType::STRING, str});
}
```

**The principle:**

> Fail loudly and early. A lexer that silently swallows malformed input makes debugging hell for every stage that comes after it.

This is demonstrated live in `tests/test_lexer.cpp`.

### Stage 2 — Parser / AST Builder ✅
 
Implemented in `include/ast.h` and `src/parser/parser.cpp`.
 
- Defined a base `ASTNode` struct with a `child` pointer (initialized to `nullptr`) and a virtual destructor to enable safe `dynamic_cast` across the tree
- Defined node types via inheritance from `ASTNode`: `SelectNode` (stores list of column names), `FromNode` (stores table name), `WhereNode` (stores a `ConditionNode`), `OrderByNode`, and `GroupByNode`
- `ConditionNode` is a separate struct holding `left`, `op`, and `right` as strings — represents expressions like `age > 20`
- Parser walks the token stream using `peek()` (look at current token) and `consume()` (read and advance) — same maximal munch principle as the lexer but at the token level
- Builds the AST by connecting nodes via `child` pointers: `SelectNode → WhereNode → FromNode → OrderByNode/GroupByNode`
- Handles optional clauses gracefully — queries without `WHERE` or `FROM` don't crash; missing nodes are detected and tree is connected accordingly
- Guards all inner loops with `END_OF_FILE` checks to prevent out-of-bounds crashes on malformed queries
## Bug Found in Stage 2 — Uninitialized Child Pointer
 
`ASTNode::child` was declared without initialization, leaving it as a garbage pointer. Any traversal of the tree (in the executor or debug printer) could crash or read invalid memory.
 
**The fix:** Initialize at declaration:
 
```cpp
struct ASTNode {
    ASTNode* child = nullptr;
    virtual ~ASTNode() = default;
};
```
 
**The principle:**
 
> Always initialize pointers. An uninitialized pointer is a ticking time bomb — it won't crash immediately, it'll crash three stages later in the hardest place to debug.
